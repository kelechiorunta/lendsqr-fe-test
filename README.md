LENDSQR Preliminary Task

Firstly, I want to appreciate LENDSQR group for giving me as well as other great developers the opportunity to learn and grow in this preliminary task. Despite the challenges faced, I was finally able to complete the task to the best of my ability. Here is a summary of the process involved.

TOOLS USED - Next js framework, Tailwind css, Node, MongoDB.

REASONS

Next js
For client-server ui flexibility and simplified routing with the App Router System.
Easy integration with API routes for user login, reset password and authentication with custom (forgot and reset) API routes and NextAuth for catchAll (api/auth) routes.
Easy integration with Next middleware for protected and non-protected routes.

Tailwind css
For dynamic, conditional and flexible inline styling with ui components. For me, SCSS alone could not be effective due to the complex ui and imported libraries needed for the task.
For easy integration and compatibility with most modern ui libraries built with React and Next js framework.
To save time from creating excessive css modules due to the complexity of the general ui.

Node and MongoDB
For persistent connection and storage to the MongoDB database
For scaling purposes to a full-stack application.

FEW ADJUSTMENTS
For the login page, I could not find and implement the Avenir Next font online so I worked generally with Work Sans which is the font used for the dashboard.
I replaced the fixed authenticated user ‘Adedeji’ from the mockup with the actual logged in user’s email for authentication testing purposes with the session provider in Next js.
I implemented a theme-switcher to toggle between light, system and dark modes for screen accessibility purposes.
I made the sidebar of the dashboard page collapsible for responsive adaptation.
